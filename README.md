# Home-Price-Prediction
# Bangalore Home Prices

**One-line:** Machine-learning pipeline + Flask web app to estimate residential home prices in Bangalore (data 2013–2018), with preprocessing, EDA, model training, and a small front-end for live prediction.

---

## Project description
This repository contains a reproducible pipeline to analyze Bangalore residential real-estate data, train regression models to predict house prices, and deploy the model via a lightweight Flask application (HTML/CSS/JS front-end). The project covers dataset cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, model selection, evaluation, and a deployed demo showing price estimates and supporting utilities (EMI calculator, budget/loan tools).
